    "## Loan Application Status Prediction\n",
    "##### Project Description\n",
    "This dataset includes details of applicants who have applied for loan. The dataset includes details like credit history, loan amount, their income, dependents etc. \n",
    "##### Independent Variables:\n",
    "1.\tLoan_ID - This refer to the unique identifier of the applicant's affirmed purchases\n",
    "2.\tGender - This refers to either of the two main categories (male and female) into which applicants are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions\n",
    "3.\tMarried - This refers to applicant being in a state of matrimony\n",
    "4.\tDependents - This refres to persons who depends on the applicants for survival\n",
    "5.\tEducation - This refers to number of years in which applicant received systematic instruction, especially at a school or university\n",
    "6.\tSelf_Employed - This refers to applicant working for oneself as a freelancer or the owner of a business rather than for an employer\n",
    "7.\tApplicant Income - This refers to disposable income available for the applicant's use under State law.\n",
    "8.\tCoapplicantIncome - This refers to disposable income available for the people that participate in the loan application process alongside the main applicant use under State law.\n",
    "9.\tLoan_Amount - This refers to the amount of money an applicant owe at any given time.\n",
    "10.\tLoan_Amount_Term - This refers to the duaration in which the loan is availed to the applicant\n",
    "11.\tCredit History - This refers to a record of applicant's ability to repay debts and demonstrated responsibility in repaying them.\n",
    "12.\tProperty_Area - This refers to the total area within the boundaries of the property as set out in Schedule.\n",
    "13.\tLoan_Status - This refres to whether applicant is eligible to be availed the Loan requested.\n",
    "You have to build a model that can predict whether the loan of the applicant will be approved(Loan_status) or not on the basis of the details provided in the dataset. \n",
